              <p class="section-text">In this project, I have simulated a blind navigation task in an unfamiliar environment using ROS and TurtleBot 2 with an RGB-D Camera. The task involved SLAM-based exploration, real-time goal object detection, and return-to-origin navigation after spotting the goal object. <br>
                Two SLAM algorithms, improved Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter (iRBPF) and RTAB-Map, were compared. Out of the two algorithms, RTAB-Map depicted a superior accuracy and reliability due to better handling of RGB-D data and loop closure. For navigation, Dijkstra’s algorithm (global planner) and the Dynamic Window Approach (local planner) were used, balancing reliability and computational efficiency. The search component tested Random Obstacle Avoidance and Frontier-Based Exploration (FBE), with FBE achieving a 100% success rate by ensuring full map coverage without blind spots or being stuck in a loop. <br>
                Overall, the project demonstrated effective and promising results in simulation, with the next step being a physical implementation and further optimisation for a faster search.</p>

              <p class="section-text">Built a real-time barcode detection application with two distinct versions: a core non-GUI version developed using only built-in Python libraries to meet assignment constraints, and an extended GUI version without restrictions for advanced functionality and live detection. <br>
                The non-GUI version is only built using basic Python libraries, having to implement each step of image detection from scratch. Implemented detection methods include: Gaussian filter, thresholding, erosion/dilation, and connected component detection. <br>
                The GUI version, built with PySimpleGUI, OpenCV, and Pyzbar, enables users to dynamically tune image processing parameters, and immediately view results on uploaded images or live webcam feeds. OpenCV was benchmarked as the optimal implementation for real-time performance. <br>
                In the future, further optimisation can be done by changing the codebase to C or C++, as well as creating an exe file for easier execution of the program.</p>
